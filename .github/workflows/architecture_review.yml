            ### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
            
            **Overall Architecture Assessment:**
            - Identify the architectural patterns used (MVC, microservices, layered, etc.)
            - Evaluate separation of concerns and module boundaries
            - Assess coupling and cohesion levels
            - Review dependency management and injection patterns
            
            **Code Organization & Structure:**
            - Analyze folder structure and naming conventions
            - Review module/component organization
            - Check for circular dependencies
            - Evaluate code reusability and DRY principle adherence
            
            ### 🔒 SECURITY REVIEW
